I've been a Raspberry Pi enthusiast for years, using them for everything from offline media players to secondary coding machines.  This experience has led me to my most ambitious Pi project yet: building a home lab using the Raspberry Pi 5.  This blog will detail the setup and implementation of this lab, focusing on how I'll use Portainer to orchestrate and manage key applications such as MySQL, Postgres, and Grafana for monitoring.  The ultimate aim is to replace my existing server infrastructure with this efficient and compact Pi-based solution."


I intend to use this as guide
