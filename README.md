I've been a Raspberry Pi enthusiast for years, using them for everything from offline media players to secondary coding machines.  This experience has led me to my most ambitious Pi project yet: building a home lab using the Raspberry Pi 5.  This blog will detail the setup and implementation of this lab, focusing on how I'll use Portainer to orchestrate and manage key applications such as MySQL, Postgres, and Grafana for monitoring.  The ultimate aim is to replace my existing server infrastructure with this efficient and compact Pi-based solution."


I intend to use this as guide 

## Features
- **Raspberry Pi 5 as the core**: Leveraging the increased processing power and capabilities of the Pi 5.
- **Portainer for container orchestration**: Simplifying application management and deployment.
- **MySQL database**: Providing a relational database for various applications.
- **Postgres database**: Offering another robust relational database option.
- **Grafana for monitoring**: Visualizing system performance, application metrics, and other data.
- **Home lab functionality**: Replacing your existing server setup with the Pi-based solution.
- **Compact and efficient design**: Taking advantage of the Pi's small footprint and low power consumption.
- **Documented build process**: Sharing your journey, challenges, and solutions through your blog.
- **Potential for expansion**: The Pi and containerization allow for easy addition of future services. (This is implied but good to call out)
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Building a powerful home lab at a potentially lower cost than traditional server hardware. (Also implied, but worth mentioning)
